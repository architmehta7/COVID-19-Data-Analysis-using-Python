## Project outline:
### In this project, I worked with the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also,I have another dataset consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe.  I merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
#### The data was recorded from Jan 2020 to April 2020
Conclusion:
- 1)The countries with higher GDP per capita recorded a high number of cases detected and greater number of deaths than countries with a lower GDP.
- 2)The countries with higher healthy life expectancy recorded more number of cases and more number of deaths.
- 3)The countries with greater social support recorded large number of cases/deaths.
- The reasons can be as follows:
- 1)Availablility of better health facilities in higher GDP countries which resulted in faster detection of cases.
- 2)The countries with high GDP like the US recorded a higher number of deaths/cases due to poor implementation of lockdown.
- 3)The number of tests which were being performed in that period in countries with lower GDP were not enough to record the number of cases.
However,there is not one particular reason, there are multiple reasons regarding the spread of the virus in a country.These are a few inferences from the data.
